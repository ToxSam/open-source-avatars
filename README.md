## 🌟 What is Open Source Avatars?

Open Source Avatars (OSA) is a growing collection of freely available 3D avatars for use in virtual reality, gaming, metaverse applications, and any other 3D environments. Our mission is to create an inclusive library of high-quality avatars that anyone can use without worrying about licensing restrictions.

This repository serves as the **data backbone** for the [Open Source Avatars website](https://www.opensourceavatars.com), containing all the metadata and information about the avatars, projects, and related resources.

## 🚀 Why Open Source Avatars?

- **Free and accessible 3D avatars** for everyone
- **Permissive licensing** that allows for personal and commercial use
- **Community-driven** development and contributions
- **Diverse selection** of avatar styles, characters, and designs
- **Compatible formats** for popular platforms and engines

## 📂 What's in this Repository?

This repository is structured as a database with JSON files containing all the metadata:

- `/data` - The core data directory
  - `avatars.json` - Detailed information about each avatar (3D models stored on Arweave)
  - `projects.json` - Collections of related avatars
  - `tags.json` - Categories and tags for organizing avatars
  - `users.json` - Creator and contributor information
  - `downloads.json` - Usage statistics
  - `avatar-tags.json` - Tagging relationships

### 🔍 Exploring the Avatars

Rather than browsing the JSON files directly, we recommend visiting our gallery at [opensourceavatars.com](https://www.opensourceavatars.com) for an interactive experience with:

- Visual previews and thumbnails
- 3D model viewers
- Filtering by tags, style, and format
- Download options for different platforms
- Creator information and attribution
